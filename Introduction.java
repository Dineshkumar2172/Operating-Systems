    // 1. An operating systems is a program that manages the computer hardware.
    // 2. It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between computer user and computer hardware.

    // users (system / application programs)-> operating system -> computer hardware (OS sits between user and hardware)
    // 1. computer hardware - resources like CPU, Memory, I/O Devices (devices we use for giving input and getting output of the system)
    // 2. application programs - wordprocessoor, spreadsheets, compilers, text editors, web browsers.

    /*
     * Types of operating systems:

     *      3. Distributes OS
     *      4. Network OS
     *      5. Real Time OS
     *      6. Multi programming / processing / tasking OS
     * 
     * Goals of OS: (how does the computer know to open a file once you double click on it? os is at play)
     *      1. Convenience
     *      2. Efficiency
     *      3. Both
     * 
     * Functions of OS:
     *      1. It is an interface between User & Hardware
     *      2. Allocation of Resources
     *      3. Management of Memory, Security etch.
