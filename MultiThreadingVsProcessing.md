# Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing

## ðŸ”¹ Multithreading
- **Definition**: Multiple threads within a single process share memory and resources.
- **Execution**: Threads run concurrently within the same process.
- **Memory Usage**: Low, as threads share the same memory space.
- **Context Switching**: Faster because switching between threads within a process is lightweight.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., web servers, file operations).
- **Example**: A web browser where multiple tabs (threads) share the same memory but perform different tasks.

## ðŸ”¹ Multiprocessing
- **Definition**: Multiple processes run independently, each having its own memory and resources.
- **Execution**: True parallel execution if multiple CPU cores are available.
- **Memory Usage**: High, as each process has its own memory space.
- **Context Switching**: Slower compared to threads due to higher overhead.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., data processing, scientific computing).
- **Example**: Running separate Python scripts for different computations.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Differences
| Feature           | Multithreading | Multiprocessing |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Execution       | Concurrent     | Parallel (if multi-core) |
| Memory Usage    | Low (shared)   | High (separate) |
| Context Switching | Fast        | Slow (higher overhead) |
| Use Case        | I/O-bound tasks | CPU-bound tasks |
| Example        | Web servers, UI applications | Data processing, ML training |

### ðŸš€ Conclusion
- **Multithreading** is efficient for **I/O-bound tasks** where waiting time is significant.
- **Multiprocessing** is better for **CPU-bound tasks** where actual computation is the bottleneck.
