# L1, L2, and L3 Cache in CPU

L1, L2, and L3 caches are hierarchical levels of cache memory in a CPU. These caches store frequently accessed data to reduce memory access time and improve processing speed.

## **L1 Cache (Level 1)**
- Closest to the CPU core and integrated within it.
- Fastest but smallest in size (typically **32KB to 1MB per core**).
- Stores the most **frequently accessed data and instructions**.

## **L2 Cache (Level 2)**
- Larger than L1 but slightly slower (**256KB to 8MB**).
- Can be **dedicated per core or shared between cores**.
- Acts as an intermediate cache between L1 and L3.

## **L3 Cache (Level 3)**
- Largest but slowest among the three (**4MB to 64MB**).
- **Shared across multiple cores**, improving multi-threaded performance.
- Helps reduce latency when different cores need to communicate and access data.

## **Why Multiple Cache Levels?**
1. **L1 is the fastest but very limited in size**.
2. **L2 provides a middle ground, balancing speed and capacity**.
3. **L3 acts as a backup cache, reducing main memory (RAM) accesses**.

This hierarchical design ensures that frequently used data is retrieved quickly, improving CPU performance and efficiency.
